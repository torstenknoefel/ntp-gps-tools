<h1 align="center"><b>gpsctl 1.13</b></h1>

## What is gpsctl?
*gpsctl* is a utility program written for Raspberry Pi computers using a U-Blox GPS board.  The
author's rig is a
[Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) with a
[Uputronix GPS board](https://store.uputronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&product*id=81),
which uses a [U-Blox MAX-M8Q](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/max-m8-series) GPS module.  Some
of *gpsctl*'s functions are generic for any GPS that streams NMEA data to a Linux serial port, and
these should work on any Linux system.  Most of *gpsctl*'s functions, however, are quite specific
to the U-Blox products, and use their proprietary UBX protocol (again, on a serial port).

## Why does the world need gpsctl?
Well, probably the world doesn't actually need *gpsctl* - but if you happen to be attempting the same
thing the author was, you might find it useful.  Configuring and controlling a U-Blox GPS connected to a
Linux host is a frustrating exercise.  The author ran into this when implementing a
[stratum 1 NTP server](https://www.endruntechnologies.com/stratum1.htm) using the aforementioned
hardware.  He needed to make some configuration changes to better support this.  Those configuration
changes required the use of the UBX protocol, and support for this on Linux is ... minimal.  Hence
*gpsctl*!  

On the other hand, anyone trying to "talk" to a U-Blox GPS from a C program might find the
code in *gpsctl* to be a useful building block.  The code in *gpsctl* includes functions for sending and
receiving UBX protocol messages, for interpreting them, modifying them, etc.  This could easily be extended to
serve other purposes; after all, not everyone lusts for a stratum 1 NTP server, and there might actually be other
useful purposes for a GPS (though I can't think of one right now).

## What, exactly, does *gpsctl* do?
Some *gpsctl* functions work for any GPS streaming NMEA data over a serial port:
* Echoes NMEA data to stdout, optionally filtered by NMEA message type.
* Infers the GPS' baud rate from the stream of NMEA data.

Other *gpsctl* functions are specific to U-Blox GPS hardware:
* Configures the baud rate that the U-Blox GPS uses for communication.
* Configures whether the U-Blox GPS transmits NMEA data.
* Infers the GPS' baud rate using the UBX protocol only.
* Configures the use of the European Galileo satellites (which is off by default in U-Blox 3.01 firmware)
and enables NMEA version 4.1 output for Galileo
* Queries the U-Blox GPS for position, time, GPS version, GPS configuration, and GPS satellite information.
  The format of query results are selectable: either plain English or JSON.
* Tests the pulse-per-second output of the U-Blox GPS (fundamental for NTP).
* Configures the U-Blox GPS for maximum timing pulse accuracy (useful for building a stratum 1 NTP server
based on the GPS' notion of time).
* Disables NMEA RMC, VTG, GSA, GSV, GLL, GGA messages and enables ZDA (for NTP driver 20 mode 8)
* Saves the U-Blox GPS configuration to on-module battery-backed memory.
* Resets the U-Blox GPS.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies *gpsctl* has (other than the standard C library) is on the JSON library
[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON), [iniparser](https://github.com/philrandal/iniparser), and the popular Raspberry Pi I/O library
[WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/).  The source for iniparser and cJSON (which have MIT licenses) are incorporated in this project.  

The WiringPi library must be present and linked.

## Why is *gpsctl*'s code so awful?
Mainly because this is the first C program the author has written in over 30 years, but also because the author
has serious deficiencies in aptitude, intelligence, and knowledge (not to mention choices of hobbies).

## How is *gpsctl* licensed?

            -q, --quiet               quiet mode  
            -p, --port                port to use (default is /dev/serial0)

            -a, --autobaud            autodetect baud rate of the u-blox module  
                                        (tries 230400, 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600)  
            -b, --baud                use specified baud rate  
            -M, --minbaud             minimum baud rate  
            --test                    test PPS output from GPS

            --galileo                 deprecated - same as --satellites
            --satellites              configure satellites only
                                        use NMEA version 4.1 or higher if Galileo satellites are enabled
            --configure_for_timing    set stationary mode,

            --reset                   reset u-blox config to defaults  

## Examples
To autodetect the current baud rate, set the pi and u-blox module to 115200 baud, configure stationary mode, Galileo satellites, and NMEA ZDA output only, and to see what it's doing

    gpsctl -a -B 115200 --configure_for_timing -vv

To autodetect the current baud rate and configure satellites only

    gpsctl -a --satellites

To view the current u-blox config

    gpsctl -a -Q config

 ## New in version 0.7 and later

 At long last, the file /etc/gpsctl.conf is parsed for configuration options.

 The [gpsctl] section is used to determine which serial port gpsctl uses.

 The other sections are honoured by --galileo and --configure_for_timing, and override the defaults if present.

 Without the gpsctl.conf file the program's behaviour will be the same as with version 0.6.

 Note: Either BeiDou or Glonass can be configured, but not both at the same time as GPS or Galileo.  If neither GPS nor Galileo are enabled, you can enable both BeiDou and Glonass.  If you try with GPS or Galileo enabled, the [gpsctl] option "prefer beidou to glonass if both enabled" (default: no) will override one of them.

## Why did you fork it, Phil?

It all started when I decided to build a [Raspberry Pi Stratum 1 NTP server](http://www.philrandal.co.uk/blog/archives/2019/04/entry_213.html).

I found the original gpsctl when looking for something to configure my Raspberry Pi plus u-blox GPS to receive Galileo
satellite output.  And then I tinkered a bit, tweaking settings, recompiling, tweaking again, and so on.

Hence the idea to use a configuration file to drive it.

Enjoy.
